Ricky Chezza is a team focused on blockchain security, specializing in non-custodial staking. Founded in 2020, we operate validators on top-tier Proof of Stake networks. 

Our portfolio continues to expand with the blockchain ecosystem as we carefully select the most promising projects.

We take pride in being active participants in the networks we support, starting from their earliest testnets. 

By doing so, we contribute to their development and make our mark in their governance processes. 
As a result, we are proud to be present in the genesis block of some of the most reputable networks. This approach is at the core of Ricky Chezza's ethos.
